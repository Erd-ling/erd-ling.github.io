  headline: "Contributed my voice to the 'Heinrich Heine in your Mother Tongue' project"
  content: The project consists of read recordings of Heinrich Heine's famous poem 'Lorelei', as translated in more than 30 languages. The recordings were collected in celebration of the 60th anniversary of the Heinrich-Heine University. I did the reading for the Serbo-Croatian version. Although I found out that my Serbo-Croatian got quite rusty, I nevertheless enjoyed reading the poem. Project credits go to Pamela Villar Gonz√°lez and Aaron Kassat.
