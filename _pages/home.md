### Welcome!

Welcome/Willkommen/Dobrodošli/どうぞよろしく/Hoş geldiniz! I am a PhD student in General Linguistics at the Institute of Linguistics (Heinrich-Heine University Düsseldorf). My areas of interest are Phonetics, Phonology and Psycholinguistics, with a recent interest in Morphology and Computational Linguistics.

This is a spectrogram of my name [ˈêrdin mujeˈzǐːnovit͡ɕ]. <br/>
Can you match all segments to the spectrogram signal?

### About me

I investigate the learning mechanisms behind phonetic, phonological and morphophonological learning, and how these mechanisms allow linguistic structure to emerge. I approach language from a discriminative error-driven learning perspective. For my PhD-project, I investigate the learning mechanisms behind phonetic category acquisition (phonetics), sound pattern acquisition (phonology) and form-meaning associations (morphophonology). To answer these questions, I use computational and experimental methods.

By investigating the mechanisms behind language learning, I hope to better understand why certain linguistic properties are apparently harder to learn than others, as well as to find out what kinds of representations emerge during learning – and whether these representations differ in kind or in degree.
